In this project, we successfully achieved promising results within the given time limit. Our implemented model effectively translates English sentences to French with a satisfactory level of accuracy, despite occasional repetition in the generated output. The alignment figures obtained closely resemble those presented in the referenced paper, indicating that our model is on the right track to function as intended.

To enhance the convergence speed of the model, we experimented with various techniques. Additionally, we explored different approaches to improve the quality of the generated sentences. We believe that by training the same architecture for a longer duration and with more data, we can achieve results comparable to those reported in the referenced paper.

\subsection{Challenges and Limitations}
Reimplementing a complex architecture from scratch presented its challenges. We had to make numerous assumptions and decisions, leading to a significant amount of trial and error. However, this project provided us with valuable insights into attention models, which we have been interested in since studying them in class. Overall, we are pleased to have participated in this project and gained a deeper understanding of how attention models function.
